#implemented with the help of REPL(READ, EVALUTE, PRINT, LOOP)
for i in range(1,11):
    print("5 X",i,"=",(5*i))


# Print the table of 5 using an f-string
# for i in range(1, 11):
#     print(f"5 x {i} = {5 * i}")

# Explanation:
# In Python, the f in print refers to "f-strings,"
# which use curly braces {} to format strings dynamically.
# Example:
name = "Ritesh"
age = 22
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
# Output: My name is Ritesh and I am 30 years old.
